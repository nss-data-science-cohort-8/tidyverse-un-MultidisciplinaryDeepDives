This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

Create a new R Notebook to complete this exercise.

1. Using the read_csv() function, read the GDP dataset into your notebook as a tibble called gdp_df. After reading it in, inspect the first 10 rows and then inspect the last 10 rows.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```


```{r}
gdp_df <- read_csv("../data/gdp_per_capita.csv")

slice_head(gdp_df, n = 10)
```

```{r}
slice_tail(gdp_df, n = 10)
```
2. Drop the 'Value Footnotes' column, and rename the remaining columns to 'Country', 'Year', and 'GDP_Per_Capita'.


```{r}
gdp_df <- select(gdp_df, -`Value Footnotes`)

gdp_df <- rename(gdp_df, Country = "Country or Area", GDP_Per_Capita = Value)
```


3. Which years are represented in this dataset? How many observations are there per year? Make a plot to view the number of observations per year.

```{r}
Count_by_Yr <- gdp_df |> 
  count(Year) 
Count_by_Yr <- rename(Count_by_Yr, Count=n)

print(Count_by_Yr)
```
```{r}
select(Count_by_Yr, Year)

# result yielded here is a single column tibble
```

```{r}
pull(Count_by_Yr, Year)

# result yielded is a row vector
```




```{r}
ggplot(Count_by_Yr, aes(x=Year, y=Count)) +
  geom_col()
```


4. How many countries are represented in this dataset? Which countries have the fewest observations?

```{r}

Count_by_Country <- gdp_df |> 
  count(Country)
Count_by_Country <- rename(Count_by_Country, Count=n)  
Count_by_Country <- arrange(Count_by_Country, Count)

print(Count_by_Country)

```





Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
